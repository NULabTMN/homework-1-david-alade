The car moved on, but ?earctl'y had
it gone more than a few yards when a
man, who has since been identified as a
printer named Gabrlnovics, sprang out
from the crowd and hurled a bomb
full at the royal car. The archduke
himself warded it off w.th his arm
and it fell at the back of the car and.
rebounding on the roid, exploded.
The automobile had by this time
moved s?ve ?1 yari. and the full force
of the exp ision fell on the following
automobi.??, which contained four mem?
bers of the Archduke's suite. They
were Count Boos-Waldeck, Baron
Ilummerskireh, Countess von Lanjus,
lady in waiting, and Lieutenant Colo?
nel von Merizzi, aide-de-camp.
The last named received a splinter
in the neck and was badly hurt. The
royal chauffeur, at the direction of the
Archduke, immediately brought the
car to a standstill. In the mean time
the would-be assassin was seized by
the police, who 1k?1 the greatest diffi?
culty in saving him from the fury of
the crowd. The Archduke, after ascer?
taining the extent of the injuries to
his aide-de-camp and seeing that he
was being medically attended to, gave
the order to proceed, and the royal car
soon afterward arrived at the Town
Hall.

THE GAME OF BASKET BALL.
Interesting and Exciting Sport For Thos
Not Able to Exercise Kegularly.
The unnounceinent that at a woman's
educational institution not far from this
city tho students played a close and ex
citing game of "basket ball" wasperhaia
the first item which attracted public at
tention to a sport that is rapidly becom
ing very popular in this country among
those who have neither the physique nor
the taste for baseball or football. The
rules of the new sport are comparatively
simple, and the ease with which the
fundamental laws of the game can be
acquired in a few minutes' practice have
served to make it popular wherever it
has been introduced, while its freedom
from much of the roughness and intri
cacy of football has also tended to make
the devotees of basket ball enthusiastic
in their praise of its merits.

Up to the present the basketball
rules have been amended each season
by additions and omissions in various
places. This year, however, the rules
have been rearranged and many rules
bear different numbers and are not
found in the same successive order.
An advantage in the new rule book
also is that at the top of the page i3
the page, so that it is no longer neccs-
indicated the rule number printed on
that page, so that it is no longer ne
cessary to turn back or forth to ascer
tain which rule is being read.
The first new feature is that the
rules became effective Nov. 1, 1904.
This settled a fixed time for everywhere
and did not leave it open for teams to
play old Ule3 because "they did not
have the new book and there is noth
ing in the rules saying when they be
come effective," In referring to the
basket, the word "basket" is not used
in contradiction to "goal."

Deadly Electric Chair.
Dr. A. P. Southwick, who is a member of
tho commission to ascertain the most
humano and practical method known to
modern science for carrying tho death sen
tence into effect in capital cases, is an enthu
siastic investigator, and since tho commis
sion was created by tho last legislature ho
has spent considerable time in making re
searches. "Do you believe in capital punishment,
doctor?" was asked.

After mature deliberation it was concluded
that hanging would have to go.
Hanging has been the fashionable mode of
punishment for centuries, but a commission
*appointed by Governor Hill concluded that it
was too harrowing. They made a number
of experiments, and finally decided upon
electricity. A bill was passed by the legis
lature, but-no provision was made as to the
way the fluid was to be applied. Finally the
Medico-legal society took the matter Uo, ap
pointed a commission, and the result was
that a particular form of applying the elec
tricity was suggested. This way of killing
off the refuse population will probably be
used in New York state hereafter. Three
ways of applying the fatal electricity were
proposed, but none of them answered the
purpose. One was passing the electri.
iots city from wrist to
wrist through the
body, another
was passing the
current from the
head to one of the

ow, however, the main object in
to get the prisoner out of the way as soon as
possible. In order to understand how quick
a man can die under the force of electricity,
let us consider first how fast a man can think.
Well, it takes just one-tenth of a second fora
nerve to communicate with the brain, ac
cording to Professor Hemholz Now Pro
fessor Tyndall estimates that an electric dis
charge occurs in one hundred thousandth of
a second, or ten thousand times more rapidly
than nerve transmission. So you see that it
it were possible a man would die by the
process described ten thousand times before
his nerves would have time to communicate
with his brain.

The one time police officer hesitated
as he entered the execution room. It
seemed to the witnesses as if he was
startled that the death chair was so
near at hand. He looked quickly at
the double row of witnesses, glanced
at the floor, swept with his eyes the
whitened walls of the room and then,
suddenly, as if coming to himself,
walked briskly over the rubber mat
and seated himself in the electric
chair. Behind Becker followed the
prison priests chanting the prayer of
death, which was repeated by the con
demned man.
